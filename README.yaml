# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This `build-harness` is a collection of Makefiles to facilitate building Golang projects, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, and more.
  It's designed to work with CI/CD systems such as GitHub Actions, Codefresh, Travis CI, CircleCI and Jenkins.

# Introduction to the project
#introduction: |-
#  This is an introduction.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  At the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...

  ```make
  -include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mintel/build-harness/master/templates/Makefile.build-harness"; echo .build-harness)
  ```

  This will download a `Makefile` called `.build-harness` and include it at run-time. We recommend adding the `.build-harness` file to your `.gitignore`.

  This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.

  Run `make help` for a list of available targets.

  **NOTE:** the `/` is interchangable with the `:` in target names

  ## GitHub Actions

  The `build-harness` is compatible with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

  Here's an example of running `make readme/lint`

  ```
  name: build-harness/readme/lint
  on: [pull_request]
  jobs:
    build:
      name: 'Lint README.md'
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - uses: mintel/build-harness@master
        with:
          entrypoint: /usr/bin/make
          args: readme/lint
   ```
